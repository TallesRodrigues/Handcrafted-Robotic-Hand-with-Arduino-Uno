Robotic Hand Using Servo Drivers. 

Each servo is connected to a pin I setup in my Arduino Uno Board. YOu can change it as you want.

You can change the movement of your fingers based on the servos you activate.

You can also change how you trigger a command wirelessly if you use a XBee, for example.
